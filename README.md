### **Wireframes:**
To help keep the design scope, wireframes were created for the proposed pages of the site. There was some deviation from the initial design as each page was implemented to improve the user experience but in general it stayed true to the initial design. 

* Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Login Page](wireframes/login-page-responsive.png)
    * [Countdown Page](wireframes/countdown-responsive.png)
    * [Wishlist Page](wireframes/my-wishlist-responsive.png)
    * [Sending / Receiving Page](wireframes/secret-santa-responsive.png)

* Desktop wireframes:
     * [Login Page](wireframes/login-page.png)
    * [Countdown Page](wireframes/countdown.png)
    * [Wishlist Page](wireframes/my-wishlist.png)
    * [Sending / Receiving Page](wireframes/secret-santa.png)

### **Color Scheme:**
In the spirit of Christmas, we have decided on a Red White and Green theme, with Red being the dominant color. All text on the site is easy to read with good contrast.
